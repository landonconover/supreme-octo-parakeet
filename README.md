# Terminal Documentation

The Terminal, aka the command line, is essential in the web developers' tool belt. This assignment is for you to document some basics about the tool, why it is so important, and some notes that will be handy for you to remember.

## Steps to complete the assignment

1. Create an index.md file on the main branch.
2. Follow the prompts below to create a markdown document inside the index.md file. For a guide on markdown, use the [GitHub Markdown Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).
3. Once your index.md file is complete, go to the repo settings on Github and then to the Pages tab.
4. To enable Github Pages, select a source branch. Select the main branch, leave the /root as the default and click save.
5. You site will publish automatially. It could take a few minutes to publish.
6. Leave the visibility **private**. *Changing this to public will result in a 0 for the assignment.*
7. Optional: Choose a theme you like.
